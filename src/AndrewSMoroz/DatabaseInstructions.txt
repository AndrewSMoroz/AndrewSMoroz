Assumptions
- The target database does not exist
- The DefaultConnection in appsettings.json specifies the target database server/database/credentials/etc.
- The below commands are run from the projects's folder (not the solution): .../AndrewSMoroz/src/AndrewSMoroz


1. dotnet ef database update -c ApplicationDbContext
     
	 This will apply the built-in Identity migrations supplied by the application template scaffolding.
     This creates the database objects necessary to support Identity.

2. dotnet ef migrations add CreateContactsSchema -c ContactsDbContext -o Data\Migrations

     This will create a new migration, in the specified subfolder, that will be used
	 to create the database objects necessary for the Contacts demo application.

3. dotnet ef database update -c ContactsDbContext

     This will apply the new Contacts migration to the database, actually creating the database objects.
